Welcome to the Hearts Welcome Repository! üéâ This is where we track onboarding for both open-source projects and contributors participating in Hearts.

## About Hearts

[<u>Hearts</u>](https://github.com/hearts) is a project by Open Source maintainers for Open Source maintainers and contributors. Our goal is to bring more recognition to contributors by tracking and notifying them of the ‚ù§Ô∏è reactions they receive on their contributions across participating projects.

## What This Repository Is For

This repository serves as the onboarding hub for projects and users joining Hearts. It helps:

* Project maintainers track the status of their project's onboarding process.
* Contributors opt in to receive notifications about ‚ù§Ô∏è reactions on their contributions.
* Provide a space for communication, updates, and troubleshooting during onboarding.

## How It Works

When a project or contributor joins Hearts, we automatically create an onboarding issue in this repository.

### Project Onboarding

* When a maintainer installs the Hearts app on their organization, we create a project onboarding issue.
* This issue helps track the setup progress and provides updates on the initial import of contributors.
* The issue also serves as a communication channel between maintainers and the Hearts team.

### Contributor Onboarding

* When you sign up, an onboarding issue is created for you here.
* You will receive a private GitHub repository where Hearts will notify you of new reactions to your contributions.
* Follow the steps in your onboarding issue to complete the process.

## Get Started

* **Maintainers**: Check your project‚Äôs onboarding issue for status updates and next steps.
* **Contributors**: Follow the link in your onboarding issue to authenticate with GitHub and start receiving notifications.
